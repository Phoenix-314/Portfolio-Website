<p>
    Attached are a couple of my desmos graphs. You can see how any individual graph works or edit them by clicking on the button ("edit graph on desmos") in the bottom right corner of each graph. The attached dates are the last time the graphs were edited. As of currently, none of my 3D graphs have been added to this website.

<h4>
    Multispring - (September, 2025)
</h4>
<p>
    A small graph that uses techniques similar to isometric projection from 3D to 2D in order to make some springs in desmos 2D

<h4>
    Matrix Addon for Desmos 2D - (April, 2025)
</h4>
<p>
    This has no clear visual. Instead, it adds the ability to use matricies in desmos 2D. This is relevant since the matrix version of desmos lacks most features of the other versions of desmos. Adding matricies to desmos 2D was particularly difficult since lists containing lists (2d lists) are not permitted. Instead, it uses a single long list with metadata concerning its own shape in order to represent a matrix. This graph adds the ability to create matricies, along with the following operations: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Elementary Row Operations (Scale, interchange, add), Reduced Row Echelon Form</li>
    <li>Matrix Creation (Identity, Zeros)</li>
    <li>Multiplication, Addition, Inner Product, Magnitude</li>
    <li>Inverse, Determinate, Transpose, Cofactor, Adjugate</li>
    <li>Projections</li>
    <li>Eigenvalues</li>
</ul>

<h4>
    Robotics Odometry Scratch Work - (October, 2024)
</h4>
<p>
    This is the graph I used to discover the (linear) odometry algorithm for a differential drive robot. It relates how measuring the rotation of wheels in contact with the floor can be used to calculate the absolute position of a moving, rotating robot.

<h4>
    Hilbert Curve - (November, 2023)
</h4>
<p>
    This shows a space filling curve.

<h4>
    Adam Optimizer - (October, 2023)
</h4>
<p>
    This was an attempt to implement the Adam optimizer in desmos. It was applied to a polynomial regression. It converges to near the correct answer, but begins to oscillate eventually.

<h4>
    First Graph - (November, 2021)
</h4>
<p>
    This was my first saved graph on one particular account, although I remember having one earlier that was lost. The ealier one depicted a couple stick houses to the right, a mountain to the left, and a well with a small animation of a bucket filling with water. The earlier one was probably made around 2019.
